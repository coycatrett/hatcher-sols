            Welcome! This is a website documenting my soltutions to the exercises in
            <em>Allen Hatcher's Algebraic Topology </em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Use the navigation button in the top left corner to explore exercises and solutions!

            The author has included useful information about the book
            <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATpage.html">on the book's download page</a>.
            See AllenHatcher's <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/#ATI">personal site</a>
            for more about his work.
        </p>

        <p>
            The purpose of this website is two-fold:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                To improve my web-development skills and gain a deeper understanding of JavaScript and client-side
                routing.
            </li>
            <li>
                To help others studying algebraic topology and to document my solutions. I love math, especially
                algebraic topology, and I love helping others with math.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I hope that this website serves some as a complementary reference for students/studiers of algebraic
            topology using Hatcher's book.
        </p>

        <p>
            This book has a reputation for being a somewhat difficult introduction to algebraic topology.
            To that end, each exercise has hints that aim to help solve a particular exercise.
            If you can't find a solution to a particular exercise, it is because I have not published a solution for it
            yet. If you would like to discuss a solution, reach me on GitHub or by email.

            This webpage is designed as a single page application (SPA) with custom client-side routing implemented in
            vanilla JavaScript with the History API.
