    The proof of <b>Proposition 1.3.</b> proves more general statements about concatenation of paths up to path-homotopy, namely, 
    that concatenation of paths is associative up to path-homotopy, each path has unique left and right identities up to path-homotopy,
    and each path has a unique inverse up to path-homotopy.
