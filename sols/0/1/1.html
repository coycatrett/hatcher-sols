        Construct an explicit deformation retraction of the torus with one point
        deleted onto a graph consisting of two circles intersecting at a point, 
        namely, longitude and meridian circles of torus.

            This solution depends on explicity constructing a deformation retraction of a punctured 
            square to its boundary square, and then passing to the quotient.

            Recall that the closed unit disk in the plane with the <a href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Maximum_norm_(special_case_of:_infinity_norm,_uniform_norm,_or_supremum_norm))">$\infty$-norm</a> is a square.
            Put $\mathbb{D}_{\infty}$
